Overview of the Project
1. Project Name:
AI Chatbot with NLP

2. Objective:
To develop an interactive AI chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques that can understand and respond to user queries. The chatbot will use a rule-based approach for intent detection and provide relevant responses based on predefined categories such as greetings, farewells, and common inquiries.

3. Key Activities:
NLP Integration: Using spaCy for tokenization and part-of-speech tagging to process user input.
Intent Detection: Implementing basic intent detection using rule-based matching of keywords and lemmas (e.g., recognizing greetings or farewells).
Response Generation: Providing responses based on detected intents by using predefined templates for each type of query.
Modular Code Structure: Designing the chatbot with object-oriented principles for easy customization, readability, and scalability.
Interactive Conversation Loop: Implementing a continuous chat loop to keep the conversation going until the user exits.

4. Technology Used:
Python: The primary programming language for building the chatbot.
spaCy: A popular NLP library used for text processing, including tokenization, lemmatization, and entity recognition.
Random Module: Used to randomly select from predefined responses to create a more natural conversation flow.
Object-Oriented Design: Using classes and functions to modularize the chatbotâ€™s functionality for improved scalability.
